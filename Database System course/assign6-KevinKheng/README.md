## Exercise 1
Insert a new, living pet into the pet table. Be sure to set the death date as NULL.

## Exercise 2
Insert an event for your pet for the current date.

## Exercise 3
Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the row you added to the pet table. This statement should change the species column to â€œhorse". Be sure to use a where clause so that you do not change the species of all pets in the table.


## Exercise 4
Delete the event that you added to the table.  Be careful not to delete all events in the table.
