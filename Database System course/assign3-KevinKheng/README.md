## Exercise 1
Find the name, city, country and height of all skyscrapers. Run this statement to make sure it works correctly.  Add an ORDER BY clause to statement that sorts the result set by year completed in descending sequence. Then, run this statement again to make sure it works correctly. This is a good way to build and test a statement, one clause at a time.  Submit the final query.

## Exercise 2
List all skyscrapers in Peoria.  Include building name, year completed and height in the result set

## Exercise 3
Find the name,  city and number of floors for all skyscrapers taller than  400 ft.

## Exercise 4

## Exercise 5

## Exercise 6
Find the name, city and number of floors for skyscrapers that were completed before 1900. Do not include incomplete skyscrapers (year completed = 0).  Order by height in ascending order.

## Exercise 7
List all abandoned skyscrapers in order by city and within each city by date completed.

## Exercise 8
Find all materials that have been used to build skyscrapers. Include only material type in ascending order and be sure that each material appears only a single time.
